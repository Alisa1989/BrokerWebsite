        </li>
        <li className="sell-list-numbered">
          <b> Staging your home </b> - Before you place your residence on the
          market, you’ll probably need to do a little bit of work to get it in
          proper viewing condition. Jon can help you prioritize these tasks and
          ensure that your property looks appealing to prospective buyers.
        </li>

          to market your house and get it in front of the right people. Jon will
          make sure that your listing perfectly highlights your home’s selling
          points so that it attracts more buyers.

      <h2>What You Need To Know</h2>
      <p>
        Selling a home can be a complex process, but there are steps you can
        take to ensure that your property is in high demand. Here are some key
        home-selling tips to keep in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li className="sell-list-unordered">
          <b>Find yourself a real estate professional </b> – Jon Hesse has
          plenty of experience selling homes, and he knows what it takes to
          attract the right kind of buyers. Use Jon Hesse and his expert team of
          professionals as a resource along the way.
        </li>
        <li className="sell-list-unordered">
          <b>Boost curb appeal - </b>First impressions can be the most important
          part, so spend some time improving your yard, driveway and the
          exterior of your home. You want the buyers to “get out of their car.”
          This should make your prospective buyers feel good about your house
          before they’ve even walked inside.
        </li>
        <li className="sell-list-unordered">
          <b>Fix up your home </b>- The majority of buyers like properties that
          are in move-in condition, meaning they won’t have to make many
          repairs, if any at all. With this in mind, it could benefit you in the
          long run to address any issues before putting your house on the
          market. Jon can shed some great light on this subject all the while
          saving you money.
        </li>
        <li className="sell-list-unordered">
          <b>Highlight selling points </b>- Buyers tend to want things like
          storage space and natural light, so work on highlighting these key
          selling points. Jon can help you identify the key features of your
          home and the best way to showcase them.
        </li>
        <li className="sell-list-unordered">
          <b>Set the right price </b>– Understandably, you’ll want to make as
          much money as possible selling your home. Jon will show you all the
          necessary data and local market trends when assisting you with setting
          the proper price. The last thing he wants is for your home to sit
          stagnant on the market without any offers.
        </li>
        <li className="sell-list-unordered">
          <b>Stage the interior of your home </b>- Most prospective buyers like
          to envision themselves living in your home, which includes placing
          their furniture and belongings inside it. Sometimes they can have a
          hard time doing this if your personal belongings, knickknacks,
          photographs and unique decor are on display. It may be advantageous to
          seek the professional advice of a “stager” to give your home a
          welcoming neutral feeling for all.
        </li>
        <li className="sell-list-unordered">
          <b>Sweeten the deal </b>- By offering to put money toward closing
          costs or remaining flexible about dates and deadlines, you may be able
          to sell your property faster. Jon will share his tips of the trade
          when the time is right.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Short Sales</h2>
      <p>
      &emsp; Sometimes we as homeowners in the Greater Sacramento area experience
        major financial setbacks that cause us to fall behind on our mortgage
        payments, which can ultimately lead to a foreclosure of our property.
        That being said, there are alternatives to foreclosure that we should
        look into and try to take advantage of with the help of an experienced
        Sacramento real estate agent. One of these alternatives is known as a
        short sale.
      </p>
      <p>&emsp; According to Wikipedia, a short sale can be defined as follows:</p>
      <p>
      &emsp; “A short sale is a sale of real estate in which the proceeds from
        selling the property will fall short of the balance of debts secured by
        liens against the property, and the property owner cannot afford to
        repay the liens’ full amounts and where the lien holders agree to
        release their lien on the real estate and accept less than the amount
        owed on the debt. Any unpaid balance owed to the creditors is known as a
        deficiency. Short sale agreements do not necessarily release borrowers
        from their obligations to repay any shortfalls on the loans, unless
        specifically agreed to between the parties. However, in California,
        legislation was passed to preclude deficiencies after a short sale is
        approved. The same is true of lenders on first loans and lenders on
        second loans — once the short sale is approved, no deficiencies are
        permitted after the short sale. (SB 931, SB 458 – Calif. Code of Civil
        Procedure §580e).”
      </p>
      <p>
      &emsp; A short sale is considered preferable to a foreclosure for some of the
        following reasons:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li className="sell-list-unordered">It is less damaging to the homeowner’s credit</li>
        <li className="sell-list-unordered">It is mutually beneficial to the homeowner and the lender</li>
        <li className="sell-list-unordered">
          It relieves the homeowner of the debts secured against the property
        </li>
        <li className="sell-list-unordered">
          It should elevate a possible eviction from a foreclosure or trustee
          sale.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you’re interested in finding out how you can sell your home through a
        short sale — or, on the other hand, if you would like to learn more
        about purchasing a short sale — it’s important to find a professional in
        the Greater Sacramento area who specializes in these complex
        transactions. Jon Hesse, one of the top real estate brokers in Northern
        California, has years of experience assisting clients through the short
        sale process. Jon and his team are prepared to do everything it takes to
