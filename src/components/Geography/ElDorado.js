      <h1>El Dorado County</h1>
      <p>
        &emsp; El Dorado County in California is an area known for its robust
        natural beauty and close proximity to some of the hottest destinations
        in the Golden State. As it’s a relatively short drive from Sacramento,
        it has become an increasingly popular spot for families, young adults
        and retirees who enjoy being close to a large metro area, yet immersed
        in gorgeous surroundings.

        &emsp; Consisting of 1,805 square miles of gorgeous hills and
        mountainous terrain, the El Dorado County website describes the region’s
        geography as follows:

        &emsp; “The County’s western boundary contains part of Folsom Lake, and
        the eastern boundary is also the California-Nevada State line. The
        County is topographically divided into two zones. The northeast corner
        of the County is in the Lake Tahoe basin, while the remainder of the
        County is in the ‘western slope,’ the area west of Echo Summit. This
        landscape invites residents and tourists alike to enjoy outdoor
        recreation activities year round.”

        &emsp; The most populous city in El Dorado County is South Lake Tahoe,
        which sits right on the border of Nevada. South Lake Tahoe is home to
        Heavenly Mountain Resort, a popular destination for skiers and
        snowboarders from all over the country. The temperatures are relatively
        mild year round, reaching an average of 80 degrees Fahrenheit in the
        summer and an average of 43 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter.
