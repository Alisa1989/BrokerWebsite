        &emsp; Sacramento County is the most populous of the eight counties in
        the Greater Sacramento area. It covers about 994 square miles and is
        home to approximately 1.4 million people. It includes the low delta
        lands located between the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River as well
        as the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. It even provides direct
        access to the Bay Area at certain points, making it a cost-effective
        alternative to the expensive San Francisco lifestyle. You can get a much
        more spacious and affordable property in Sacramento County than you can
