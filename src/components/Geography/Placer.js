        &emsp; If you’re looking for a place to settle down in the Golden State

        hours from San Francisco, you may want to consider viewing Placer County
        homes for sale. There’s a lot to love about this picturesque part of
        Central California, which contains the cities and towns of Auburn,
        Colfax, Lincoln, Rocklin, Roseville and Loomis, among others.

        Country – Newcastle to Dutch Flat; and The High Sierras – Alta to Tahoe
